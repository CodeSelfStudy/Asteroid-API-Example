Sample App
==========

I put together this quick Flask site to demo some things that people asked about at the past couple of meetups.

To run this site on your computer:

1. Clone this repo.
1. Make a Python 3 virtualenv. On Ubuntu, I use the command `alias mkve3='mkvirtualenv --python=\`which python3\`'` which I have aliased to `mkve3`. You can probably also use Python 3's venv feature.
1. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
1. Run the server: `python app.py`.
1. Visit http://localhost:5002/
